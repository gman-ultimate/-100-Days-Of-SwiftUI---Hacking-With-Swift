### My Progress With: 100 Days Of SwiftUI

ðŸ‘‹ Hi All!

This is my progress with Paul Hudson's (@twostraw) increadible course called 100 Days Of SwiftUI. Each of these days, I created a .swift file with notes and from each of the lessons. 

Please check out the course here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui
It's completely free!

This git repo was designed in case anyone wanted a quick look back at one of the days. My notes aren't associated or made in partnership with Hacking With Swift. They are simply my way of remembering the detailed world of SwiftUI. They were designed to make sense to me, if the make sense to you great! If they don't: I'm sorry. 

Thanks!
